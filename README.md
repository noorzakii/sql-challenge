For data modeling the attached screenshot to this repository is an entity relationship diagram using the QUICKDBD app. After inspecting the CSV files the result is a cohesive relationship between all tables and data.

Also, there’s 6 CSV files that are being used for data engineering. The data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints are all defined. The composite key which is used for dept_employee and dept_manager table is created to handle two primary keys.

The data analysis answers the questions as seen below:
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
